Several Medicare plans are available for senior citizens and other qualified members to enroll into every year 
that are offered by different health insurance organizations. 
While a lot of information regarding individual plans exist, it is difficult to compare plans based on various criteria 
to make an informed choice to suit unique situations of individual members as well as 
for plan benefit designers to compare plans and design benefits that meets unique requirements and 
are competitive in different markets. 
The purpose of this document is to detail the analysis of the Medicare plans data across US and 
provide useful comparison and summary details.
